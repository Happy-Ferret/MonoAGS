First off, thank you for considering contributing to MonoAGS. Every contribution is very appreciated.

## Contributing Code

If you want to submit a small bug fix, or feature, fork the repository's master branch, make your changes in your fork and then
submit a pull request.
If you want to work on a big feature/refactoring, please open an issue first so that we can start a discussion. 
Before opening an issue, check if an issue already exists, and if it does, then respond on that issue and say you want
to work on it so we can discuss.
This is mainly to ensure you don't do hard work for no reason, as we may already have conflicting plans.

## Creating issues

You can create issues for bugs, feature requests or general questions. Please search first to see if a similar issue was already created.

## Voting on issues

Please vote on issues that are important to you (thumbs up the first comment of the issue). This gives us a clue about
what feature/fix is most desired.
