# MonoAGS (Adventure Game Studio reimagined in Mono)

MonoAGS is an engine (and eventually, editor and tooling) for creating 2D Point&Click adventures.

The project is still in very early stages, no official release as of yet, so expect it to be rough around the edges for some time, and expect rapid changes.
With that, it's not currently recommended to start developing your epic 3 year game development project with it, but if you're thinking of a short game, that can be completed in a month or two, then please: give us a try, and let us know of any thoughts you had about the engine (issues, feature requests, etc).

### Why another engine?

AGS (Adventure Game Studio) is a very nice tool for creating adventure games. It has a very friendly workflow and gets the job done. However, it's also slightly outdated, with hard to maintain code and generally not powerful and flexible enough as other existing tools. The editor, while friendly and focussed, can also use a re-haul, as if you want to deviate just a little bit from the classic formula, you might find out that you need to fight with it some.
MonoAGS was created with the following goals in mind:
1. Have an engine which is more powerful than the current engine.
2. Have an engine which is more flexible than the current engine.
3. Have a workflow (with the accompanied tooling) which is friendlier than the current engine.

Once those goals are deemed completed, it is intended to pitch MonoAGS as the next version of AGS to the community.
